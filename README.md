# BHMIE-Python-Translation
Adapted from Absorption and Scattering of Light by Small Particles by Bohren. The original code was written in Fortran 77, so it was updated to Fortran 95 using a compiler, then translated into Python3. The output is the same as shown in the book, verifying the translation is accurate.
